# Math Notes
Inline calculator to run on browser.

## Dependencies
Created using ECMAScript, and [math.js](https://mathjs.org/).

## ECMAScript features
- Modules;

If your browser doesn't support these features, the calculator will not work.

## To do:
- [ ] Save information on browser
Save inputed information on browser to return the same information after the site is reopened.

- [ ] Syntax highlighting
Add color to syntax to differenciate variables and comments 

- [ ] Create percentage calculus
```
5% of 100 (resolve 5)

10% off 50 (resolve 45)

50% on 10 (resolve 15)

50 as a % of 100 (resolve 50%)

70 as a % on 20 (resolve 250%)

20 as a % off 80 (resolve 75%)
```
- [ ] Currency convertion
```
1 USD in EUR

1 USD + 50 EUR

1 BRL * 2
```

- [ ] Avoid 3 loops (parse input, print input and print response);
Performance improvement to avoid multiple loops
